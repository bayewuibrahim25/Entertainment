## *Short History of HTML and CSS*
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee to structure content on the World Wide Web. Over time, new versions introduced better semantics and multimedia support.  
HTML5, introduced in 2014, added elements such as header, main, section, article, and footer, allowing for more organized and accessible web content.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced later to separate content from presentation. CSS3 added features like gradients, animations, and media queries, which enable responsive and visually appealing designs for different devices.

## *HTML Tags and CSS Techniques Used*
### *HTML Tags*

-  <section> – Groups related content in the main area  
-  <table> – Displays structured data (e.g., movie list)  
-  <form> – Collects user input on the contact page  

### *CSS Techniques*
-  *Element, Class, and ID Selectors* – To style specific parts of the site  -
-   *Pseudo-classes* – Such as :hover for interactive navigation links  
-   Box Model and Flexbox* – To manage spacing and responsive layouts
